# Mark-Analysis-System
A system that records student marks, displays them and provides a search feature. <br/>
This branch uses classes and stores student data as objects therefore more effective than in the<br/>
main branch. (This is created with help from my Dad.)

How to run: 
 - Clone the whole repo
 - Run Visual Studio
 - Open the solution file (.sln) under the repo with VS
 - Run the solution by clicking the run button.

More specific program features can be found in features.md <br/>
