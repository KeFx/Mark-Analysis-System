### Main Menu
The program is a Visual Basic console application that infinitely loops a menu prompt when run and *only* exits <br/>
when user enters the option "-1". Except for that, there are three available action options: 1. Enter new data for a student,<br/>
2. Display all data with average, min and max, and 3. search for a student's data by ID number. <br/>
**Any other inputs here would lead to an error:<br/>**
